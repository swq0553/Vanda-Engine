Compiling the source code

In this tutorial I’ll explain how to compile the source code of Vanda Engine.

Requirements

In order to compile the code and run the program, you should install the following programs:

    Microsoft Visual Studio 2005
    OpenAL 1.1 driver

Please download OpenAL driver from GitHub.

Downloading the source code

Download latest source code (Win32-src and Editor-src) of VE from GitHub or Sourceforge.

Compiling

Note: <version> refers to the latest version of VE source code.

In order to compile the source code, you should use Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.  I have used Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 professional edition service pack 1 to compile the code.

Vanda Engine contains 2 projects: Editor-<version>-src refers to the Editor of VE and Win32-<version>-src is responsible for rendering the game in full screen mode. When you make a change in the core of VE, you should apply it to both Editor-<version>-src and Win32-<version>-src projects. when you add a function that refers to the editor of VE (such as UI), you should apply the code to Editor-<version>-src project.

Compiling the editor

Download Editor-<version>-src and open VandaEngine1.sln. Hit F5 to build the code and run the program.
Compiling Win32

Download Win32-<version>-src and open VandaEngine1Win32.sln. Hit F5 to build the code and run the program.
